# Augmenting Paths

When we talked about the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find the maximum flow
through a graph, I mentioned the "find an augmenting path" function. You're
going to implement this function. Start with the template I provided in
`code.js`. Use an adjacency list data structure to represent the graph and node
names, not indices, to indicate start and end node. The function returns a list
of node names, starting with the start node and finishing with the end node. If
start and end node are the same, it should return a list containing only this
node. If there is no path, you must return an empty list.

Test your new function; I've provided some basic testing code in `code.test.js`.

To illustrate, here's an example graph:
![example graph](graph.png)

Here's the call for this graph:

```javascript
var graph = {'foo': {'boo': 7},
             'boo': {'foo': 3, 'bar': 2},
             'bar': {'boo': 4}};
augmentingPath(graph, 'foo', 'bar');
```

The call would return `['foo', 'boo', 'bar']`.

Feel free to use other data structures, but you'll have to change the test code
accordingly.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the worst-case big $\Theta$ complexity of your implementation? Add your
answer, including your reasoning, to this markdown file.

The worst case $\Theta$ complexity of this implementation is $\Theta(V+ E) $.  This is because the for loop iterates for each edge connected to the vertex, and this happens for each recursive call. The function
will recurse if the edge connects to a vertice not already visited. This limits the overall time complexity because we don't process nodes that we have already visited in that path which allows us to only have to
search V vertices in the worst case. The for loop iterates E times, where E is the number of edges connected to that vertex. In the worst case the for loop will iterate through all nodes and edges in the graph 
before it finds the end node, or returns the empty array. So the time complexity is $\Theta(V + E)$.
